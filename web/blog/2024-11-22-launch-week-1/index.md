**Cyclops is having its very first launch week, starting on November 25th!**

For an entire week, we will be unveiling a feature a day - that's **five features** in total!

We don't want to spoil the surprise just yet, but if you're as **impatient** as we are, we invite you to join our **Discord session** that is happening on **Monday, November 25th, at 6 pm CET**! We will preview all of the features we plan to reveal throughout the week and host an Ask-Me-Anything session afterward.

To reserve your spot, visit the [event in our Discord](https://discord.gg/MvecUE9y?event=1308173306821742612) server and mark yourself as interested.
