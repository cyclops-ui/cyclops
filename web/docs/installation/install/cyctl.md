## Install cyctl

Cyclops has its own CLI tool called cyctl.
To install Cyclops in your cluster with cyctl, first install cyctl with homebrew:

```shell
brew install cyctl
```

> _Check if the installation was successful by running `cyctl -v`_

## Install Cyclops

To install Cyclops into your cluster, run:

```shell
cyctl init
```

> _There are additional options when installing with cyctl, which you can check out [here](../../cyctl/cyctl_init.md)_

It will create a new namespace called `cyclops` and deploy everything you need for your Cyclops instance to run.

To access Cyclops UI, use the following command:

```shell
cyctl serve
```

You can now access Cyclops in your browser on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
